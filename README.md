## Responsive MERN Jobify 

- MERN project with MongoDB, ExpressJS, React and NodeJS which I built from the scratch. 
- Project  focusing on adding, editing, deleting, filtering, sorting and searching job opportunities.
- I have learned new backend technologies. First one is ExpressJS which is build on top of NodeJS. 
- I used it for creating backend server which contains my API and it's handling all my request for database. Next new technologie for me is MongoDB. 
- In Mongo Atlas I stored my whole database.
- With help of React implemented many generic reusible components which save me lot of lines of code and I can use them in future. 
- Last big thing for me was implementing authentication with jwt.
